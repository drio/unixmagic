description: "A program that outputs ASCII art"

The poster's title is rendered in large block letters, much like the output of
the [`banner`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_(Unix)) command. `banner`
takes a text string and prints it in oversized ASCII characters, originally
meant for printing headers on line printers so you could tell whose printout
was whose in a shared printer room. It was a common utility on Unix systems and
a fun one to play with at a terminal.
