The <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wall.1.html">wall</a> command is a command-line utility that displays the contents of the specified file or otherwise its standard input on the terminals of all currently logged-in users. It is typically used by root to send out shutting down message to all users just before poweroff.
