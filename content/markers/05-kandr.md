These three sets of initials refer to key figures in Unix history:

**dmr** - Dennis M. Ritchie, co-creator of Unix and creator of the C
programming language.

**kt** - Ken Thompson, co-creator of Unix alongside Ritchie. The poster shows
"kt", though his actual Bell Labs login was "ken", which is how he's usually
referenced in early Unix source code and documentation.

**bwk** - Brian W. Kernighan, co-author of "The C Programming Language" and
"The UNIX Programming Environment", and contributor to many Unix tools
including `awk` (the 'k' in awk).
