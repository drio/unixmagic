description: "A key programming language in the creation of Unix"

Dennis Ritchie created C at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, and Unix was
rewritten in it shortly after. Before that, Unix was written in PDP assembly,
which meant it only ran on PDP machines. Rewriting it in C made it possible to
port Unix to other hardware. You just needed a C compiler for the target
platform. That portability is a big reason Unix spread through universities and
eventually into commercial use.
