The shell gets a prominent spot on the poster because it really is the center
of how you use UNIX. It's the command-line interface where you type commands,
launch programs, chain them together with pipes, and generally tell the system
what to do.

What set the UNIX shell apart was that it doubled as a programming language.
You could use it interactively, but you could also write scripts to automate
repetitive work. Most operating systems at the time didn't give you that.

The original was the Bourne shell (`sh`), written by Stephen Bourne at Bell
Labs. Countless variants followed (`csh`, `ksh`, `bash`, `zsh`) but they all
trace back to that first one.
