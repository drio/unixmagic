A [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) is a text file
containing a sequence of shell commands that run as a program. Instead of
typing commands one at a time, you write them into a file and execute it.

Shell scripts are what made UNIX administration practical. System startup,
backups, log rotation, batch processing - all of it was (and still is) driven
by shell scripts. Because the shell already knows how to run programs, redirect
I/O, and handle pipes, a script gets all of that for free. Add variables,
loops, and conditionals, and you have a real programming language that's
tightly integrated with the operating system.
