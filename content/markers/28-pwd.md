[`pwd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html) prints the full path
of your current working directory. It stands for "print working directory" and
is one of the most basic navigation commands in UNIX. You use it to figure out
where you are in the filesystem. It's been part of UNIX since the early days
and is a shell built-in on most modern systems.
