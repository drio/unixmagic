[`uucp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) (Unix-to-Unix Copy) was a suite
of programs for copying files between Unix systems over phone lines using
modems. Written by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs in 1978, it was one of the earliest
ways Unix machines could talk to each other.

UUCP was the backbone of Usenet and early email between sites. Machines would
dial each other on a schedule, exchange queued files and messages, then hang up.
It wasn't fast, but it connected Unix systems years before the internet was
widely available.
