The tree-like shape the wizard is manipulating is likely a reference to the
UNIX filesystem hierarchy. UNIX organizes files and directories as a tree
rooted at `/`, branching into subdirectories like `/usr`, `/bin`, `/etc`, and
so on. You navigate it with commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.

The branching form could also represent process trees. Every process in UNIX
has a parent, forming a tree rooted at `init` (PID 1).
