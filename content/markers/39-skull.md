The skull-like spigot connected to the shell most likely represents
`/dev/null`, the special UNIX device that discards all data written to it.
Redirecting output to `/dev/null` sends it into a void. Nothing comes back.
The skull is a fitting symbol for where data goes to die. See also the
[/dev/null](#annotation-10-null) entry.

It could also be a nod to UNIX
[daemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)), background
processes that run without a terminal. The gargoyle-like appearance of the
spigot fits the daemon imagery.
