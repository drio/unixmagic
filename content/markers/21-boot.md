description: "The booting process (or Unix Networking Sockets)"

I have to admit, this object looks more like a boot than a sock, but I find it
hard to believe that the author would leave out a reference to sockets,
considering how important they are, not only in UNIX but in the history of
operating systems.  

For that reason, I see two possibilities:


- If it is a boot, it may represent the booting process of the UNIX operating
system, a fundamental part of bringing the system to life.

- Alternatively, if it is a sock (granted, a thick and oversized one! 😄), it
is likely a playful reference to UNIX network sockets.  Network sockets were an
abstraction pioneered by UNIX in BSD UNIX (4.2BSD, 1983).  Sockets provided a
unified interface for interprocess communication (IPC), enabling processes to
communicate both locally (on the same machine) via UNIX domain sockets, and
over a network using TCP/IP.  The socket API from BSD was later adopted by virtually every other operating
system.

For more on the history of BSD sockets, see [Berkeley Sockets –
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets), or read the
official Linux man page for
[`socket()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html).
